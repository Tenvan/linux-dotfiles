Awesome Alt-Tab Switcher
========================

This plugin integrates the familiar Alt-Tab functionality in the
[awesome window manager](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome).

Features:

* Live previews while alt-tabbing AND/OR Opacity effects for unselected clients
* Easily adjustable settings
* No previews when alt-tab is released within some time-frame
* Backward cycle using shift
* Intuitive order, respecting your client history
* Includes minimized clients (in contrast to some of the default window-switching utilies)


Installation
------------

First clone the repo into your `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome` directory:

```Shell
    user@example:~$ cd $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome
    user@example:~/.config/awesome$ git clone https://github.com/troglobit/awesome-switcher.git
```

Then and add the dependency to your Awesome `rc.lua` config file:

```Lua
    local switcher = require("awesome-switcher")
```


Configuration
-------------

Optionally edit any subset of the following settings, the defaults are:

```Lua
    switcher.settings.preview_box = true,                                 -- display preview-box
    switcher.settings.preview_box_bg = "#ddddddaa",                       -- background color
    switcher.settings.preview_box_border = "#22222200",                   -- border-color
    switcher.settings.preview_box_fps = 30,                               -- refresh framerate
    switcher.settings.preview_box_delay = 150,                            -- delay in ms
    switcher.settings.preview_box_title_font = {"sans","italic","normal"},-- the font for cairo
    switcher.settings.preview_box_title_font_size_factor = 0.8,           -- the font sizing factor
    switcher.settings.preview_box_title_color = {0,0,0,1},                -- the font color
    
    switcher.settings.client_opacity = false,                             -- opacity for unselected clients
    switcher.settings.client_opacity_value = 0.5,                         -- alpha-value for any client
    switcher.settings.client_opacity_value_in_focus = 0.5,                -- alpha-value for the client currently in focus
    switcher.settings.client_opacity_value_selected = 1,                  -- alpha-value for the selected client
```

Then add key-bindings.  On my particular system, and I guess most,
Shift-Tab is captured by the keygrabber as a single key, namely
`ISO_LEFT_TAB`. Therefore, this is what my keybindings look like:

```Lua
    awful.key({ "Mod1",           }, "Tab",
      function ()
          switcher.switch( 1, "Alt_L", "Tab", "ISO_Left_Tab")
      end),
    
    awful.key({ "Mod1", "Shift"   }, "Tab",
      function ()
          switcher.switch(-1, "Alt_L", "Tab", "ISO_Left_Tab")
      end),
```

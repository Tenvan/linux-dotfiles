7.5.7 06/09/2016

After making the articles and making the colouring scripts I thought we can better reorganize and rename some of the icon sets. We can even dispense of one.

Summary

Sardi Mono Grey is deleted.
Sardi Mono Numix Grey is renamed to Sardi Mono Numix Colora.
Sardi Flat Orange is renamed to Sardi Flat Colora.


Sardi Mono Numix Grey is replaced with Sardi Mono Numix Colora.

Sardi Mono Numix Grey can be made via colouring scripts inside Sardi Mono Numix Colora. We can therefor dispense of it.


Sardi Mono Orange is renamed to Sardi Mono Colora as we can make any colour aka Sardi Colora.


Sardi Mono Gray can be deleted as it can now be created via Sardi Mono Colora.
All you need is three colours. Via these scripts you can make the same colouring scheme as Sardi Numix Grey

Made several tests with Sardi Ghost Flexible and changed the script to get back from black to white icons

7.4.2 11/08/2016

sardi colora index.theme
32 to 16

sardi ghost flexible will have same colors as sardi in the toolbar

sardi mono grey - ommitted the actions folder - 90% of these icons are now in sardi due to
our decision. For maintenance reasons this is also best.
One major folder Sardi/scalable/actions to rule them all.

made 10 icons named xxx_trayicon aaaaaa to be inline with look

made sure all tray-icons were in sardi and no longer in sardi ghost flexible for maintenance reasons - they should
be grey "aaaaaa"

all sound icons are gone in sardi ghost flexible
coming from sardi status

mint icons are gone in sardi ghost flexible coming from sardi

sardi vertexed and mono vertexed

changed the icon for folder-new and added link to it folder-add

Archlinux budgie, cinnamon, deepin, gnome, gnome classic, i3, mate, plasma, xfce


plasma-media-center link added
recovered drumsticks - got lost in the versions



7.4.0   10/08/2016

made a choice to make several icons in action from white color to aaaaaaff - grey

Thus making the icon theme also compatible with the lighter themes.
A compromise to the white icons we used to have.
Network icons, variety icon, clipit, mintupdate, weather icons, view-refresh, stop.

If you do not like this decision.
Copy/paste an older version of Sardi and mix the old with the new

For now we are testing this in Sardi Chakra. It is the intention if this works for dark
and light themes. That Sardi will be replaced with Sardi Chakra

In the proces made a lot of changes to the icons of sardi scalable actions.
Made some extra icons for kde Chakra in the folder actions.
Found the music icon in the toolbar to be in mimetypes audio-x-generic-symbolic that now points
to sound-icon.

It was too much work to log every detail.

Sardi Colora will replace Sardi Grey, Sardi Red and Sardi Orange.
A script is provided to change the colours to whatever colour you want.
Grey, Red, Orange or any other colour. Used Sardi Orange for default.

So Sardi Colora is in essence the old Sardi Orange.

revisited Sardi Mono Mint-x-Grey
restyled this set like I did the two new arc themes.
Update with the latest files from linuxmint.


experimenting with view-refresh and view-refresh-symbolic
added notifications to sardi
checked network icons - conformity as goal

7.2.2  30/07/2006

rescaled the png for places 16 22 24
no originals present (in png)
blue symbolic png are not used - check original from horst3180


7.2.1 30/07/2016

added go-home icons to the arc themes


7.2.0 29/07/2016

NEW ICON SET based on the great work of horst3180
https://github.com/horst3180/arc-icon-theme

consistent look with the design choices

Sardi Mono Arc and Sardi Flexible Arc


Made Sardi Mono Vertexed more coherent with the latest choices in design
Folder actions is gone
index.theme updated
equivalent to Sardi Vertexed

Made Sardi Vertexed more cohorent with the latest choices in design
Folder actions is gone - were black icons on a dark theme
not quite visible
index.theme updated
image-missing in status  - red icon - changed to gray icon - not so intrusive as color
original is included for testing

cleaned up Sardi Ghost Flexible - many icons have been replaced with links
Some megabytes were saved.

Version 7.1.5

added 55 category icons to all subsets
55x5 icons extra

checked the number of icons in each folder and subset are the same or have a reason not to be the same.

added the new evolution icons in 48/categories also to the scalable/categories
checking all the missing categories against numix

Version 7.1.3 and 7.1.4 of 28/07/2016

Fixed 7 icons for evolution mail client in preferences
folder 48 has been handy for all subsets


Version 7.1.0 of 28/07/2016

I skipped logging in detail since it would have taken me more time to log than to actually change things but here is what I did.

Made it obvious in the numbering that 6.2 and 7 version are completely different.

Changed the structure of the Sardi icons folders

From scalable

to

16 22 24 32 48 64 128 and scalable.

This will allow current and future problems to be solved.
Icons that do not 'behave' properly can get an other icon at the desired width.
This gives more flexibility to the end-user to pop in an icon they like.

Choose to go for white icons in the toolbar : network and sound icons

Tried to minimize the MB by inheriting to one basic theme Sardi. A lot of work with only 5MB less out of 134 MB.

Checked to see if I was missing icons that the Numix icon team had created in the mean time in the various subsets of Sardi.

During my testing I did not install Numix (used as inherit for Sardi) and checked that all icons were in Sardi in the various subsets.

Changed the numix icons I did not like. Mostly making some of the icons white instead of blue and green. Goal was an uniform white look for the symbolic icons.

Again the icon set was retested on the various operating systems.

Version 6.2.6 of 24/07/2016

applied all changes to the four subsets as well after testing


Version 6.2.5 of 24/07/2016

new icon : evolution

change icon : network-idle in status to see a white icon in systembar for all sardi based sets.
Sardi mono was already white. Now all themes have same icon.

Changed the look for all icon sets regarding icon of network - red and orange look
extra animations when connecting to wired network.

added 5 mintupdate icons from numix to all status folders

checked the sound icons - audio-volume ...

In this process added some other icons from numix status 24
battery, phone, battery mouse, dialog, skype, xfpm links to previous ...
Only in MONO for testing

313 icons from status have been copied from mono to the rest of the sets

New icon set Sardi Flexible
You can change this icon set by running two scripts on the folders apps, categories, devices and places. The rest remain the same colours.

Some examples

red    to green

find -name "*.svg" -type f -exec sed -i '/fill="#ffffff"/!s/fill="#c5304e"/fill="#85ab3d"/g' {}  \;
find -name "*.svg" -type f -exec sed -i '/fill:#ffffff/!s/fill:#c5304e/fill:#85ab3d/g' {}  \;

find -name "*.svg" -type f -exec sed -i '/fill="#ffffff"/!s/fill="#85ab3d"/fill="#FBB73E"/g' {}  \;
find -name "*.svg" -type f -exec sed -i '/fill:#ffffff/!s/fill:#85ab3d/fill:#FBB73E/g' {}  \;


supernova to ming

#FBB73E    to    #2D5E62


find -name "*.svg" -type f -exec sed -i '/fill="#ffffff"/!s/fill="#FBB73E"/fill="#2D5E62"/g' {}  \;
find -name "*.svg" -type f -exec sed -i '/fill:#ffffff/!s/fill:#fbb73e/fill:#2D5E62/g' {}  \;

find -name "*.svg" -type f -exec sed -i '/fill:#ffffff/!s/fill:#FBB73E/fill:#1793D1/g' {}  \;



Curious blue is the colour I choose to launch Sardi Flexible. Although any of them could have been great.



curious blue to  choose a colour out of 16.5 million (gpick is a nice program - online colorchoosers)

#1793D1  to #choosecolour


find -name "*.svg" -type f -exec sed -i '/fill="#ffffff"/!s/fill="#1793D1"/fill="#choosecolour"/g' {}  \;
find -name "*.svg" -type f -exec sed -i '/fill:#ffffff/!s/fill:#1793D1/fill:#choosecolour/g' {}  \;


Example
Curious blue to nero
#1793D1 to #2e2e2e

find -name "*.svg" -type f -exec sed -i '/fill="#ffffff"/!s/fill="#1793D1"/fill="#2E2E2E"/g' {}  \;
find -name "*.svg" -type f -exec sed -i '/fill:#ffffff/!s/fill:#1793D1/fill:#2E2E2E/g' {}  \;
